# rotational-kinetic-energy-calculator
this is my first project i did which is about making calculator use the rotational kinetic energy formula


Rotational energy or angular kinetic energy is the portion of an object's total kinetic energy that results from its rotation. Observing rotational energy independently around the axis of rotation of an object reveals the following dependence on the object's moment of inertia, there are many examples of this, including Flywheels and dynamos, Molecules, Turbines. In addition, the Earth's daily rotation around its axis generates rotational kinetic energy.
whereas:

      angular velocity
is a pseudovector representation of how fast the angular location or orientation of an object changes with time (i.e., how quickly an object rotates or revolves relative to a point or axis) the unit is radians per second (rad/s).

      moment of inertia  
is the amount of resistance a body has to having its speed of rotation around an axis changed by applying a torque (turning force) and the unit is (kg.m^2)

      Kinetic Energy 
is a type of energy that can be possessed by an item or a particle because of the motion that it is involved in and has a unit of Joules (J)


How to use the calculator: 
This calculator's interface is straightforward and user-friendly. After selecting a variable from the drop-down list, a grid will display under the option button showing what you need to enter on the lift and an empty boxes on the right that's where you need to enter the value, then you must click the calculate button and your result will appear straight away.
